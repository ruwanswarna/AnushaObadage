## Glad to see you here! &nbsp;
I am a Software Engineering student aspiring to be a fullstack web developer.
My main interest lies on backend developing, but I am comfortable in frontend development too.

In addition to being a student at National Institute of Business Management, I am currently following <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-front-end-developer" target="_blank">Meta Front-End Developer Specialization</a> course series at coursera.com.


### Some of my personal interests
🚀 - I'm interested in rockets, space flight and space in general.

🌎 - I'm fairly active in reddit where I get to learn new stuff.

😍 - A big fan of spaceX.

😕 - Used to write to roar.lk before it was discontinued.
